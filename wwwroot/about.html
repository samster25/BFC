      <h1>Our Members</h1>
      <p>Berkeley Finance Club is made up of highly-motivated student leaders from a broad range of academic disciplines. Many members juggle a busy schedule between BFC and a variety of extracurricular activities including entrepreneurship, fraternities and sororities, and other business clubs. Outside of their interest in finance, we have members that are real-estate entrepreneur, competitive horse-back rider and table tennis player. Before their junior-summer internships, many members have gained professional experiences through working at private equities, hedge funds, boutique investment banks, trading shops, and investment management firms.</p>

      <br>

      <h1>Our Organization</h1>
      <p>Berkeley Finance Club is a student organization dedicated to professional development and building relationships. Berkeley Finance Club carries its unique culture: we believe having mentors is a great component to an individualâ€™s success. We hold many professional and social events to build relationships within and beyond the organization. Through a close-knit community where members develop professional support and friendships, we are able to best provide effective mentorship. BFC works to build a strong organization that members can rely on during and after college.</p>

      <br>

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>Our core mission is to help undergraduates who are interested in finance reach their individual potential. In a close-knit community, we provide mentorships, professional development, and career networking opportunities. Club members will learn practical knowledge about the financial market and how to land a job in the financial industry. MBA and MFE students, professionals, and other upperclassmen will help our members prepare through resume critique, networking, and interviews.</p>
